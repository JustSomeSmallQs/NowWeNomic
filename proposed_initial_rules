Rule 27 (Mutable)

      If two or more mutable rules conflict with one another, or if
      two or more immutable rules conflict with one another, then the rule
      that has existed in its present state longest takes precedence.
        If at least one of the rules in conflict explicitly says of itself

      over another rule (or type of rule), then such provisions shall
      supersede the age method for determining precedence.

Rule 28 (Mutable)

      If players disagree about the legality of a move or the
      interpretation or application of a rule, then a player may invoke
      judgement by submitting a statement for judgement to the Speaker.
      Disagreement, for the purposes of this rule, may be created by the
      insistence of any player.  When judgement is invoked, the Speaker
      must, as soon as possible, select a Judge as described in the Rules.
      The Speaker must then distribute the statement to be judged, along
      with the identity of the Judge, to all players.

      A judgement is delivered by submitting that judgement to the
      Speaker, who must then distribute that judgement to all players

Rule 31 (Mutable)

      A legal judgement is either TRUE, FALSE, or UNDECIDED.  The
      judgement may be accompanied by reasons and arguments, but such
      reasons and arguments form no part of the judgement itself.  If a
      judgement is accompanied by reasons and arguments, the Speaker must
      distribute the reasons and arguments along with the judgement.

Rule 32 (Mutable)

      All judgements must be in accordance with the rules; however, if

Rule 33 (Mutable)

      In addition to duties which may be listed elsewhere in the rules,
      the Speaker shall have the following duties:
        -register new players
        -remove inactive players
        -maintain a list of all players and their current scores, and
         make such a list available to all players
        -maintain a complete list of the current rules, and make such a
         list available to all players
        -make a random determination whenever such determination is
         required by the rules

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 34 (Mutable)

      If a player believes that the rules are such that further play is
      impossible, or that the legality of a move cannot be determined with
      finality, or that a move appears equally legal and illegal, then the
      player may invoke judgement on a statement to that effect. This state
      is to known as "paradox".
      If the statement is judged TRUE, then the player who invoked judgement
      shall be declared the winner of that game, and the game ends.
      The winning player becomes the Speaker of the next game. The game
      is suspended, and the new speaker shall create a "restart
      proposal": this is several proposals that are all subject to a single
      vote. In general, this proposal should consist of undoing the rule
      change or changes that caused the paradox to occur, and make as few
      changes to the ruleset as possible. However, there is no limit to
      the number of rule changes nor the type of rule changes proposed
      this way.
      The new Speaker distributes the restart proposal to all players. Voters
      may vote FOR or AGAINST within the prescribed voting period. If
      quorum is met, and a majority of votes legally cast are FOR the restart
      proposal, all rule changes within the restart proposal are enacted,
      and the game is restarted as though the new speaker reached the target
      number of points.
      If the restart proposal is not passed, the new Speaker creates a
      new restart proposal, and the process is repeated until a restart
      proposal is passed.
        This rule takes precedence over every other rule determining the
      winner of the game.

Rule 35 (Mutable)

      If a player believes that the Speaker is not fulfilling their duties,
      that player may issue a Statement of No Confidence by distributing it
      to all players. A Statement of No Confidence must clearly describe
      itself as such.
      All Players may do one of the following: SUPPORT the Statement of
      No Confidence, or OBJECT the Statement of No Confidence within the 
      prescribed voting period. (It is assumed that the player who distributed
      the Statement supports eir own statement, unless they
      say otherwise.)
      The Statement of No Confidence if upheld if:
      - The Speaker does not object and more players support than object
      to the Statement; or
      - The Speaker does object, and more than twice as many players support
      than Object to the Statement.
      If the Statement is upheld, then the Speaker immediately abdicates.
      If the Statement is not upheld, the player who made the Statement
      loses 10 points.

      The Speaker may abdicate either by explicitly announcing their
      abdication, or may be forced to abdicate by other means.
      When the Speaker abdicates, the game enters a state of Crisis.
      Any player wishing to stand as Speaker may do so. They must
      declare their intention to stand within one week of the Speaker
      abdicating.
      When the deadline to stand as Speaker has passed, Players then
      vote for their preferred candidates, using an Instant Run-off
      Vote. The voting phase lasts for one week.
      If the vote does not produce a single winner, the Speaker is chosen
      at random from amongst the tied candidates using any mutually
      agreed method to chose one at random.

out the duties of that office, which may include the deduction of points or expulsion from office. 
If an office is empty, its duties revert back to the speaker. The speaker may appoint a player to fill 
the office by any means ey see fit (nomination, election, etc...). They may also set term limits, or remove 
players from office at their discretion.

The following restrictions apply:
-  Players may not gain more than 5 points per week from holding offices. If a player holds multiple offices, 
this limit applies to the total from all offices.
- Players may not lose more than 5 points per infraction for failing to carry out the duties of their office.

Rule 51 (Mutable)

The Speaker shall appoint three Justices, with the consent of the majority of Players. 
If judgement is invoked by a Player who is not a Justice, these three Justices shall vote for a verdict as a panel. 
This panel counts as a singular "judge" for the purposes of the rules. The three Justices shall vote among themselves 
for a Chief Justice. If judgement is invoked by a Justice who is not the Chief Justice, the Chief Justice shall be the 
first judge to be selected. If judgement is invoked by the Chief Justice, the Speaker shall be the first judge to be selected. 
In all cases, if a Judge beyond the first must be selected to judge a statement, it shall be a Voter selected by the Chief Justice 
with the consent of the other two Justices.

All three Justices together shall be called the Court. A Justice who is not the Chief Justice may be expelled from the Court 
by a validated Decree of Expulsion by the Chief Justice. The Decree of Expulsion, at the very least, shall specify which 
Justice the Chief Justice intends to expel, and shall specify the reason that the Chief Justice intends to expel the Justice 
in question. The Decree of Expulsion does not take effect until after a week from when the Decree of Expulsion is published. 
The other Justice must explicitly consent to the expulsion of the Justice. This is called "validation of the Decree of Expulsion."
The Speaker shall then appoint another Justice to the Court.

The Chief Justice may be expelled from the Court by the other two Justices jointly issuing a Decree of Expulsion. This must be validated by the Speaker. The Speaker shall then appoint another Justice to the Court.
